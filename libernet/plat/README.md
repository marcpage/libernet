# libernet.plat - low-level tools

These tools are meant to abstract platform differences of simplify common low-level actions.

## TODO

1. Top level libernet.py should launch server and create bundles
2. Creating a bundle should connect to a server (default localhost:8000) to push parts
3. Simplify directory structure (sha blocks stored in /blocks/server|localhost/sha256/identifier.raw)
